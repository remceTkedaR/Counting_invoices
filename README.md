"In the directory na_xx, there are invoices (files) in xls format.
 The program retrieves the files from the specified directory, extracts
 the sum value, and adds up all the sums from the xls files.
 Then it saves the sum value in a txt file in the chosen directory.
 I needed such a program so that I wouldn't have to manually calculate
 the sum of these invoices every time before sending them.
 Because it was important to me that the total sum of these invoices
 does not exceed a specified amount per month."
